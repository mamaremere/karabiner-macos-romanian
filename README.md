# karabiner-macos-romanian
A few key mappings to help with using a MacBook Pro's Romanian keyboard layout

# Usage

A simple way to make these changes available in your Karabiner config directory is to run the following two commands:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications
curl -o ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/macos_romanian.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamaremere/karabiner-macos-romanian/main/macos_romanian.json
```

Once the json file is present on your machine, you need to manually enable the settings from "Karabiner/Preferences.../Complex modifications/Add rule/Enable all (Romanian Keyboard changes)"
